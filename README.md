You will be taken to the notes page which looks similar to this:

![notes page](./public/assets/images/notesPage.jpg)

To enter a new note, click on the "Note Title" text to enter a new title for your note. Then click on "Note Text" to enter the note that you would like to remember.  Once you have entered something for both title and text, a save button will show up in the upper right hand corner of the page, right next to the new note (pencil) button.

Once you select save, your note will move over to the left side of the page with the other notes. You can click on the title of your note to see it in the big window again or you can click the garbage can to delete your note.
